# Decorator Pattern in Java: Learning and Exercises

Welcome to the Decorator Pattern learning repository! This repo is designed to help you understand and implement the Decorator Design Pattern in Java through a set of three hands-on exercises.
Overview

The Decorator Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. It is often used to adhere to the Open-Closed Principle of object-oriented design, which states that classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
Key Concepts

    Component Interface: Defines the base interface for the objects that can be decorated.
    Concrete Component: The class that implements the base interface and has some basic functionality.
    Decorator: A class that implements the same interface as the concrete component and wraps it to add additional functionality.

# Real-world Analogy

Imagine you order a coffee. You can add sugar, milk, or cream to it without changing the fundamental nature of the coffee. In this analogy:

    The coffee is the concrete component.
    Sugar, milk, and cream are decorators that enhance the coffee.
